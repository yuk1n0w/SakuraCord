# SakuraCord architecture

SakuraCord is a SwiftPM-backed macOS application collected in
`SakuraCord.xcworkspace`. SwiftPM remains the build source of truth; the
workspace is a convenience entry point.

## Package ownership

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `App` | SwiftUI application, AppKit bridges, app state, authentication UI, settings, and the plugin-host executable. |
| `SakuraCordModels` | Stable domain values, typed snowflakes, messages, commands, interactions, and provider events. |
| `DiscordProtocol` | Provider contract, REST and Gateway implementation, Discord DTO decoding, credentials, request scheduling, and offline provider. |
| `SakuraCordPersistence` | Account-scoped GRDB database, migrations, and user-authored drafts. Discord workspace and history state is never persisted. |
| `MessageRendering` | Parsed message documents, Discord Markdown conversion, and attributed-content planning support. |
| `MediaPipeline` | Media cache interfaces plus voice/video signaling, transport, capture, playback, Opus, H.264, and DAVE integration. |
| `SakuraCordPluginSDK` | Plugin manifest, capability, and permission contracts. |
| `DaveKit` | Swift wrapper over the vendored libdave/MLS implementation used by `MediaPipeline`. |

Dependencies point inward toward models and explicit protocols. Views do not
construct Discord requests or own network transports.

## Application state

`AppModel` is a Main Actor observable projection over a `ChatProvider` and
`SakuraCordDatabase`. It coordinates navigation, session-memory caches, drafts, message
presentation, forum state, interactions, and voice state for the current app
workspace. Views receive narrow values or the model reference.

Launch state is explicit:

- `--offline`, `--offline-long-server-list`, and
  `--offline-forum-performance` construct deterministic fixture providers and
  an in-memory database with Discord networking disabled.
- A normal launch restores a real account session, presents native sign-in, or
  reports a connection failure. It never falls back to mock data. The complete
  chat layout remains a data-free skeleton until the live Gateway bootstrap is
  ready; no account rail, channel, member, read-state, or message presentation
  is restored from disk.

High-frequency presentation state such as remote typing is kept in narrower
observable models so it does not invalidate the complete app tree.

`AppUpdateController` owns Sparkle's `SPUStandardUpdaterController` for the
application lifetime. It starts only when the canonical release bundle contains
the complete production update configuration. Source, debug, ad-hoc developer,
and offline builds omit that configuration, make no update request, and leave
the native **Check for Updates…** controls disabled.
Production checks the signed feed every six hours while the app is running, or
after launch when a check is overdue, and presents Sparkle's standard update
alert when a release is available. Sparkle persists the user's automatic-check
and automatic-download preferences. Installation remains manual by default.
Sparkle's standard user driver reports no-update and update-cycle failures.
The General settings pane also persists a regular/nightly release-track choice.
`AppUpdateController` supplies the selected signed feed through Sparkle's
dynamic-feed delegate. Changing tracks immediately requests a silent Sparkle
information check, or queues one until the current update cycle ends. When that
probe finds an update, the controller asks Sparkle to present its normal update
alert; an up-to-date result remains silent. Returning to
the regular track selects the stable feed immediately; Sparkle offers the next
regular release whose shared workflow build number is newer than the installed
nightly build rather than performing an unsupported downgrade.

## Discord boundary

`ChatProvider` is the application-facing boundary. `MockChatProvider` provides
deterministic fixtures, while `DiscordRESTProvider` owns authenticated
production behavior.

Within the production provider:

- `GatewaySession` alone owns the Gateway socket, compression stream, heartbeat
  and ACK tracking, resume state, reconnect policy, and connection generation.
- `DiscordRESTProvider` owns authenticated request preparation, rate-limit
  scheduling, caches, capability gates, upload coordination, safety stops, and
  domain-event decoding.
- REST and Gateway share one `DiscordClientMetadata` source and one provider
  lifetime, but production gives them separate provider-owned `URLSession`
  connection pools. A confirmed REST transport timeout can therefore replace
  only the stalled pool without interrupting Gateway heartbeats. Safe reads may
  retry once on the replacement; mutations are never replayed after an
  ambiguous failure. A session-wide safety stop still cancels both without
  affecting unrelated app networking.
- Every authenticated REST route uses the central transport. Views and feature
  helpers do not create one-off authenticated `URLSession` paths.
- Production Gateway ETF is parsed directly from the decompressed bounded byte
  buffer into a JSON-compatible value tree. Dispatch DTOs decode directly from
  that tree, avoiding a second JSON serialization/parser pass while retaining
  the same typed validation and event ordering.
- `CatboxAttachmentUploader` is a separate unauthenticated app service used
  only after an explicit choice in the oversized-attachment warning. It never
  receives Discord credentials or sends a Discord message; its validated HTTPS
  result is inserted into the originating draft.
- `DiscordAPIDiagnosticStore` receives REST attempts and responses, attachment
  uploads, native-authentication traffic, and main, voice, and remote-auth
  Gateway envelopes at those transport boundaries. It discards user-authored and
  credential-bearing values, IDs, nonces, request IDs, and rate-limit bucket IDs
  before retaining a bounded in-memory session log. The Diagnostics settings
  pane exports the retained JSON Lines data and reports when older entries were
  dropped. Its optional disk capture is off by default and writes private JSON
  Lines session files under Application Support only after the user enables it.
  Each capture stops at 64 MiB, the directory retains at most four managed
  session files (256 MiB total), and Clear Logs removes both the memory ring and
  saved session files while resuming a fresh bounded file when capture remains
  enabled.

The current production capability gates and request contracts are documented
in [PROTOCOL_BASELINE.md](PROTOCOL_BASELINE.md).

## Authentication and persistence

Native authentication obtains only identifiers issued by Discord's legitimate
flow and presents MFA or user-completed hCaptcha when requested. A newly issued
credential remains memory-only while the main Gateway connects; a valid
`READY.user` supplies its account ID before the credential is stored through
`KeychainCredentialStore`. Failure or cancellation discards the pending value.
An approved QR credential or an older stored credential that predates
installation-identity persistence performs a bounded, best-effort unauthenticated
lookup before Gateway startup: one Apex request, followed by one `/experiments`
fallback only when Apex fails or omits the identity. Discord may omit the
optional identity from both successful responses; SakuraCord then starts
Gateway without it. The lookup runs once per provider and does not replay the
authentication exchange or force an otherwise valid credential through login.
Passwords, cookies, captured authorization headers, and analytics identifiers
are not persisted.

Multiple account credentials may coexist as separate Keychain items. The app
keeps only the saved account's display name, username, avatar URL, last-used
date, and preferred account identifier in user defaults so the account picker
can identify sessions without reading every secret or issuing profile probes.
Switching accounts disconnects and drains the current account-scoped work,
then bootstraps the selected existing credential through the same provider
path used for launch restore. It does not replay the login exchange. Logging
out from account management removes only the selected account's Keychain item
and picker metadata; logging out the active account also disconnects its live
session before returning to the remaining saved accounts.

An explicitly insecure, debug-only build flag can migrate the credential once
from Keychain into a mode-`0600` file within the app's sandbox Application
Support container. It is excluded from release and update-enabled packages and
is not the production credential contract.

Only user-authored drafts are stored through `SakuraCordPersistence`.
Credentials never enter GRDB, fixtures, logs, or plugin APIs. Discord
workspace, message, read, member, and Gateway state is session-memory only. A
database migration drops the obsolete tables from earlier builds while
preserving drafts. Normal and offline runs use separate storage behavior.

Startup and account switching publish READY-derived read state in one atomic
Main Actor update after building it off-main. Once the initial channel is known,
the app starts its read-only newest-history request concurrently with the
remaining navigation projection and consumes that single in-flight task when
the channel loader starts. This prefetch is process-only coordination: it is
cancelled on account/session reset and never persists messages across launches.

Authenticated performance launch modes retain detailed signposts and exact
resource windows for startup, account switching, DM/server/channel navigation,
older-history pagination, timeline/member scrolling, parsing, state commits,
and rendering. They use real credentials and network data while suppressing
acknowledgements and other account mutations; offline fixtures are not accepted
as production performance evidence.

The normal app also keeps a bounded, session-memory performance diagnostic
projection. It samples process CPU and physical memory once per second,
aggregates slow operations already covered by app signposts, and records a
short spike history with non-sensitive feature-state booleans. Settings can
display and export that projection as JSON. It never records account content,
music metadata, credentials, cookies, identifiers, or URLs, and resetting or
quitting discards it.

## Message and media flow

History responses and Gateway events decode into the same domain message
model. Updates merge only fields present in the event. `MessageRendering`
parses message content; it does not own a competing message-row view.

Every rendered conversation surface—guild text and announcement channels,
direct and group direct messages, voice-channel chat, regular threads, and
forum-post conversations—configures the same virtualized
`NativeMessageTimelineView` and Core Graphics row painter. Surface-specific
headers, pagination, permissions, composers, and thread/forum state remain
outside that shared row engine. SwiftUI/AppKit hosting inside the timeline is
bounded to interaction surfaces that need native controls, including editing,
media playback, menus, pickers, and component interactions.

Direct and group direct messages select a bubble presentation within that same
engine rather than a separate view. Conversation content—text, replies,
reactions, images, code, link previews, forwards, and stickers—renders as a
bubble aligned to the sender's side, with no avatar or author line; a group
names each incoming sender once per run. Discord's own surfaces stay on the
standard row, because a component grid is a bot interface rather than
conversation. A forward renders its snapshot's content under a short header,
without the source channel, origin guild, or dated backlink the standard row
draws. Layout code and the row painter must agree on which message they read:
a forward's text, images, and embeds live in its snapshot, while its stickers
are still resolved from the message.

The bubbles themselves are `NSGlassEffectView` instances, not painted fills.
Subviews always render above their host's own drawing, so the glass cannot live
inside the row canvas; it sits in a host behind the canvas, which stays
non-opaque and draws text over it. That host is viewport-sized with zero-based
bounds and recycles its views: a glass container spanning a long conversation
allocates backdrop storage for the whole document, and the container renders
nothing under a shifted bounds origin. The quick switcher's selection uses the
same arrangement for the same reason.

The channel member inspector likewise uses one virtualized AppKit/Core Text
canvas. Its bounded visible-row overlays remain mounted and animated during
live scrolling so avatars, decorations, presence, and activity emoji preserve
their normal presentation. As rows enter and leave the viewport, their hosting
views are recycled rather than allocated and destroyed. Cached canvas frames
remain underneath as a zero-gap presentation while optional new animated-frame
expansion is deferred until motion ends. The animation decode scheduler tracks
timeline and member-list gestures independently, so one surface ending a
gesture cannot reopen the decode lane while another is still moving. Canvas
image requests use presentation-sized pixel budgets (96-pixel
avatars/decorations, 64-pixel emoji, and 32-pixel guild badges), while full-row
nameplates retain their 512-pixel budget. All decoded state remains in bounded
process-memory caches and is discarded at process exit.

`MediaPipeline` owns public-media caching and the complete native voice/video
stack. `DaveKit` is an implementation dependency of `MediaPipeline`; the app
target does not import it directly.

## Music

YouTube Music playback runs inside a `WKWebView` that `MusicPlayerModel` owns
for the app's lifetime. There is no public YouTube Music playback API, and its
licensed audio only decodes inside Google's own player, so the page is the
audio engine and the app reads and drives it rather than reimplementing it.
Nothing of the page is shown: it is mounted at two points square and does no
layout or painting worth the name. Everything the listener sees is drawn
natively. A WebKit process is therefore the floor for playback, not a choice.

The page presents as Safari. Google refuses sign-in to a user agent it can
identify as an embedded view, so the desktop user agent is what makes the
surface work at all. The session persists in the default website data store;
nothing about it is copied into app storage.

An injected observer reports playback state as JSON, and `MusicBridgeEvent`
decodes it as a value so the contract is testable without a web view. None of
the page's markup is a published contract: every read is defensive, a payload
that no longer parses is dropped rather than applied, and an advertisement is
reported as playing audio but never as a track. The observer follows Better
Lyrics' clock boundary: YouTube's movie player supplies authoritative time,
duration, transport and buffering/seeking state; media events report seeks,
stalls and track changes immediately; and a one-second snapshot corrects any
missed event. Native interpolation uses the sampled wall time and playback
rate, and advances only while the page says its clock is actually running.
Playback state lives on its own observable model so those corrections do not
redraw the app tree.

Searching runs inside the page rather than against a reimplemented client:
the page holds the credentials, API key and client context, so a signed-in
listener searches as themselves and no key has to be maintained here. The
response tree is walked for its row renderer rather than indexed by a fixed
path, because InnerTube reshapes between builds. Playing a result clicks a
link so the page's own router swaps the track, which a document reload would
otherwise interrupt.

Community lyrics are fetched natively and do not depend on the page. Unison
and BiniLyrics provide the first rich word/syllable tier; Unison and Bini line
timings follow, then LRCLib and Better Lyrics Legato. An unsynced answer is
retained only when every timed alternate misses. Independent sources start
together so their fallback latency overlaps, but the result is resolved in
that quality order rather than by whichever network request finishes first.
If all community sources miss, the signed-in page's own Lyrics tab supplies
YouTube Music's plain copy as a final readable fallback.
The aggregator Better Lyrics clients prefer sits behind a browser challenge
and is not used from the native client. A recording is matched on duration,
because a lyric timed against a different cut drifts further out of step the
longer it plays, and no lyric beats a confidently wrong one. Real word-level
timings are used where a source carries them; a line-only source is presented
as line timing rather than fabricated word timing. Both tiers use Better
Lyrics' small presentation lead so the native fill lands with the voice.

TTML-authored translations and timed transliterations stay attached to their
source lines. Romanization and translation are separate persisted display
choices in the Music menu and are off by default. When enabled, the native
language layer uses source decorations first, then batches only undecorated
non-instrumental lines through the same public Google translation surface used
by Better Lyrics. Those requests are issued from the music page rather than
from the app: the service answers a native client 429 whichever host, header
or user agent it is asked with, while the identical request from a page is
answered normally, and the page is already open to keep playback alive.
Romanization asks for a real source language rather than `auto`, because
`auto-Latn` is answered with an English translation rather than a
transliteration; an undeclared language is detected once per lookup first.
Requests are cancelled with the track, duplicate output is discarded, and
results remain in the process-only lyric cache; no lyric or translation is
written to disk. Romanization is presented as a compact
supporting capsule and translation as an unboxed secondary line, while the
primary lyric remains the only content carrying the full vocal glow.

The now-playing bar sits inside the account panel's existing glass alongside
the voice status. The lyrics panel takes the side slot the member list would
have had, since they cannot both usefully occupy one column.

A voice session takes the audio. `voiceSessionState` is the single choke point
for every path into and out of a call, so the coordination lives there; the
model only resumes music it paused itself, so a track the listener stopped
during a call stays stopped afterwards.

## Plugins

`SakuraCordPluginSDK` defines future-facing capability and permission
contracts. `SakuraCordPluginHost` is a separate executable and signing target,
but it is intentionally inert and currently loads no plugins. No plugin
receives a Discord credential or credential handle.

The sandboxed runtime, installation workflow, and extension points are roadmap
work, not an implemented architecture claim.

## Packaging

`script/build_and_run.sh` builds the debug or release SwiftPM product, assembles the `.app`,
compiles the selected Icon Composer source with `actool`, embeds frameworks and
resource bundles, copies the complete third-party notices into the app's
otherwise hidden `Contents/Resources/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, and ad-hoc signs
the result.

The canonical icon sources are:

- `App/Packaging/SakuraCord.icon`
- `App/Packaging/SakuraCord Flower.icon`

`script/package_dmg.sh` uses the release configuration, verifies the app
signature, builds the DMG, verifies the image, and writes its SHA-256 digest.
Developer ID signing and notarization are not currently part of the release
workflow.

Stable and `vX.Y.Z-Beta-N` tag releases enable the canonical Sparkle
configuration, generate a signed `appcast.xml` from the same tag-specific DMG,
and validate the feed signature,
archive signature, bundle metadata, and nested code signatures before staging
both files on a draft GitHub Release and publishing them together. The workflow
refuses to replace assets on an already published tag. Sparkle signing keys
exist only in GitHub repository secrets. Each tag must contain a reviewed
`Releases/<tag>.json` with the complete GitHub and Discord copy. CI validates
that versioned file but never generates or rewrites its authored notes or
announcement description. The workflow uses the same complete Markdown body
for the GitHub Release and signed appcast, derives the Discord embed title from
the tag, posts the pre-made embed description with a generated role mention
and release button, and stores public copy/delivery checkpoint assets for
idempotent repair runs.
The source branches maintain `main` as an ancestor of `nightly`. A dedicated
main-push workflow fast-forwards nightly when it has no independent commits.
When the branches have diverged, it creates a normal merge, runs the complete
CI suite against that merged tree, and pushes only after validation. Conflicts
or rejected non-fast-forward pushes stop without rewriting either branch.
Workflow-authenticated pushes do not recursively trigger another CI run; an
exact fast-forward is already covered by the triggering main run, while a new
merge commit is explicitly validated before publication. Release validation
also requires every stable or beta tag commit to be reachable from nightly.
Nightly beta tags must point to commits on the `nightly` source branch, use
human-facing `vX.Y.Z Beta N` release and Discord titles, and use tag-specific
`SakuraCord-vX.Y.Z-Beta-N.dmg` assets. They run the same validation and
packaging job, publish as GitHub prereleases, and select their dedicated
Discord channel and role. Only after a
nightly prerelease's assets are publicly re-downloaded and compared does the
workflow atomically update the signed appcast on the generated `nightly-feed`
branch. The application reads that feed from
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SakuraCordApp/SakuraCord/nightly-feed/appcast.xml`.
If a maintainer edits the GitHub Release body after publication, a
release-edit workflow downloads the unchanged DMG,
preserves its build number, regenerates and verifies the signed appcast with the
current body, and replaces only the appcast asset. The two release paths share
global release concurrency so this refresh cannot race the initial
publication. Maintainers can dispatch the same workflow with a tag to repair an
older feed. The public feed is
`https://github.com/SakuraCordApp/SakuraCord/releases/latest/download/appcast.xml`.
