# Third-party notices

## Discord client sound effects

SakuraCord includes the classic Discord client sound effects for message
notifications, incoming and outgoing calls, voice join and leave, disconnect,
mute and unmute, deafen and undeafen, camera on and off, and screen-share
start, end, viewer join, and viewer leave.

- Source: Discord's public first-party web-client asset bundle and
  `https://discord.com/assets/`
- Retrieved: 2026-07-29; screen-share assets re-resolved from the current
  first-party client on 2026-08-23
- Verification: the live web-client module names and content-addressed asset
  URLs were resolved directly. The classic assets' HTTP ETags match the
  full-length hashes in the independently archived 2019 asset list; the camera
  assets come from the current first-party client.

   Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
   submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
   (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
   Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or
   contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You
   under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
   litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
   Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and
   in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a

   appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only
   and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices
   within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to
   the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution
   notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
   provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,

   Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
   distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in
   this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
   Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to
   the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License,

   tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
   applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to
   in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including
   any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
   to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
   commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of
   the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work
   or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
   acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
   and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
   obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
   responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You

   liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
   reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## Generated emoji catalog

`App/Sources/SakuraCord/Resources/emoji-catalog.json` is generated by
`script/generate_emoji_catalog.swift`. It combines the fully-qualified entries
from Unicode Emoji 17.0 with the complete matching alias arrays from the
Emojibase English JoyPixels shortcode dataset. Skin-tone variants inherit their
base emoji's aliases. The raw upstream files are not bundled or committed.

## YouTube Music player observer

SakuraCord's YouTube Music bridge adapts the page-observation approach from
Kaset, an unofficial YouTube and YouTube Music client for macOS. No file is
copied verbatim; what is derived is the way the page is read — reading
playback state from the media element rather than the play button, whose
label is localised; gating artwork on the literal `src` attribute, because
`img.src` resolves an absent attribute against the page URL; preferring the
structured player metadata over the player bar's text, which mixes in
localised view counts; and preferring a ready media element's clock over the
progress bar's attributes, which can stop updating while playback continues.

Lyrics, a browser extension that adds time-synced lyrics to YouTube Music. No
file is copied; what is derived is its approach — the ordering of sources and
their fallbacks, the request shapes for the community lyric service, the
handling of TTML with per-word span timings, the treatment of an unstamped
line as an instrumental break drawn as a note, and the progressive fill of a
line as it is sung.

Better Lyrics is licensed GPL-3.0, as SakuraCord is.

Better Lyrics' preferred aggregator is not used. It is reached through a
browser challenge that mints a short-lived token, and answering that from a
native client would be working around an access control rather than using the
service as offered.

### Google Translate language decoration

When the listener explicitly enables romanized or translated lyrics,
SakuraCord batches only lyric lines missing provider-supplied language metadata
through the public Google Translate request shape used by Better Lyrics. Like
Better Lyrics, the request is made from the music page, which is the only
context the service answers. Primary lyrics still work when this optional
request fails, and generated language text is retained only in memory.

### BiniLyrics

BiniLyrics supplies open search results that point to TTML lyric documents.
SakuraCord accepts documents only from BiniLyrics' HTTPS storage origin and
uses their real word or syllable span timings when available.

### Better Lyrics API / Legato

The public Legato endpoint provides a final line-timed KuGou fallback using the
Better Lyrics API service contract. SakuraCord does not send or manufacture an
API key and treats rate limits or uncached protected responses as an ordinary
provider miss.

### LRCLib

Line-timed and plain fallbacks are looked up on LRCLib, an open lyric database
intended to be called by third-party players. It requires no credential. SakuraCord
identifies itself in its `User-Agent` rather than presenting as a browser,
which is what the service asks of its callers.

Lyrics remain the property of their rights holders. SakuraCord stores no
lyrics: each is fetched for the track being played and held only in memory.
