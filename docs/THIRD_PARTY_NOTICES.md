# Third-party notices

## Discord client sound effects

SakuraCord includes the classic Discord client sound effects for message
notifications, incoming and outgoing calls, voice join and leave, disconnect,
mute and unmute, deafen and undeafen, and camera on and off.

  `https://discord.com/assets/`
- Retrieved: 2026-07-29
- Verification: the live web-client module names and content-addressed asset
  URLs were resolved directly. The classic assets' HTTP ETags match the
  full-length hashes in the independently archived 2019 asset list; the camera
  assets come from the current first-party client.

## Generated emoji catalog

`App/Sources/SakuraCord/Resources/emoji-catalog.json` is generated by
`script/generate_emoji_catalog.swift`. It combines the fully-qualified entries
from Unicode Emoji 17.0 with the complete matching alias arrays from the
Emojibase English JoyPixels shortcode dataset. Skin-tone variants inherit their
base emoji's aliases. The raw upstream files are not bundled or committed.

## HCaptcha Swift package

SakuraCord pins the Paicord fork at revision
`29de12bd290c5cc9c61b3e3c15fe9a9d21449465`.

The license text in both that fork and the upstream SDK says the SDK is made
available to Enterprise customers under the MIT license. Before publicly
distributing SakuraCord source or binaries with this dependency, confirm that
the project qualifies for that grant or replace the dependency with an
appropriately licensed implementation. Reproducing the notice below preserves
the attribution but does not resolve that eligibility question.

## YouTube Music player observer

SakuraCord's YouTube Music bridge adapts the page-observation approach from
Kaset, an unofficial YouTube and YouTube Music client for macOS. No file is
copied verbatim; what is derived is the way the page is read — reading
playback state from the media element rather than the play button, whose
label is localised; gating artwork on the literal `src` attribute, because
`img.src` resolves an absent attribute against the page URL; preferring the
structured player metadata over the player bar's text, which mixes in
localised view counts; and preferring a ready media element's clock over the
progress bar's attributes, which can stop updating while playback continues.

## Lyrics

SakuraCord fetches lyrics natively. Two things are owed here.

### Better Lyrics

The provider chain, the source contracts, and the presentation follow Better
Lyrics, a browser extension that adds time-synced lyrics to YouTube Music. No
file is copied; what is derived is its approach — the ordering of sources and
their fallbacks, the request shapes for the community lyric service, the
handling of TTML with per-word span timings, the treatment of an unstamped
line as an instrumental break drawn as a note, and the progressive fill of a
line as it is sung.

Better Lyrics is licensed GPL-3.0, as SakuraCord is.

- Source: `https://github.com/better-lyrics/better-lyrics`
- Retrieved: 2026-08-21
- Derived in: `App/Sources/SakuraCord/Services/Music/`

Better Lyrics' preferred aggregator is not used. It is reached through a
browser challenge that mints a short-lived token, and answering that from a
native client would be working around an access control rather than using the
service as offered.

### LRCLib

Lyrics are looked up primarily on LRCLib, an open lyric database intended to
be called by third-party players. It requires no credential. SakuraCord
identifies itself in its `User-Agent` rather than presenting as a browser,
which is what the service asks of its callers.

- Service: `https://lrclib.net`
- Used in: `App/Sources/SakuraCord/Services/Music/LRCLibProvider.swift`

Lyrics remain the property of their rights holders. SakuraCord stores no
lyrics: each is fetched for the track being played and held only in memory.
